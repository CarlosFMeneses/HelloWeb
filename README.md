This document takes you through the basics of using NetBeans IDE to develop web applications. It demonstrates how to create a simple web application, deploy it to a server, and view its presentation in a browser. The application employs a JavaServer Pagesâ„¢ (JSP) page to ask you to input your name. It then uses a JavaBeans component to persist the name during the HTTP session, and retrieves the name for output on a second JSP page.
